## Part 1: Multiple linear regression using baseball data




$\\$






#### Part 1.1: Creating a few commonly used baseball statistics


Let's explore which statistic has the highest correlation with the number of runs a team has scored. 

We can start by creating a few commonly used statistics/metrics for quantifying hitting ability by running the code below. 


```{r}
# install.packages('Lahman')
library(Lahman)
library(dplyr)
# View(Teams)
# reduce the data frame to the main batting statistics of interest
team_batting <- select(Teams, yearID, teamID, G,  W,  L, R,  AB,  H,  X2B, X3B,  HR,  BB,  SO, SB, CS,  HBP, SF)
# get commonly used composite statistics 
team_batting <- mutate(team_batting,
                       X1B = H - (X2B + X3B + HR), 
                       BA = H/AB, 
                       OBP = (H + BB)/(AB + BB),
                       SlugPct = (X1B + 2 * X2B + 3 * X3B + 4 * HR)/AB,
                       OPS = OBP + SlugPct)
# only use teams that have played the 162 games in a season (the number of games currently in a MLB season)
team_batting <- filter(team_batting, G == 162)
  
```





$\\$






#### Part 1.2: Which statistics are most correlated with runs



Let's look at the coefficient of determination ($R^2$) between runs a team scores (R) and the following statistics:

 * HR:  home runs
 * BA:  batting average
 * SlugPct: slugging percentage
 * OBP:  on base percentage



```{r}
# r^2 for runs with HR
cor(team_batting$R, team_batting$HR)^2
# r^2 for runs with BA
cor(team_batting$R, team_batting$BA)^2
# r^2 for runs with SlugPct
cor(team_batting$R, team_batting$SlugPct)^2
# r^2 for runs with OBP
cor(team_batting$R, team_batting$OBP)^2
# r^2 for runs with OPS
cor(team_batting$R, team_batting$OPS)^2
```




$\\$





#### Part 1.3: Visualizing the relationships



Let's visualize the correlation between the main variables of interest: R, HR, OBP, and SlugPct.



```{r}
pairs(select(team_batting, R, HR, OBP, SlugPct, OPS))
```




$\\$









#### Part 1.4: Comparing David Ortiz and Derek Jeter's OPS



On-base plus Slugging (OPS) seems like the composite statistic that has the highest correlation with runs. Let's compare David Ortiz and Derek Jeter's Slugging percentage to see who is better. 





```{r}
# create Ortiz_info info from the Master data frame 
(Ortiz_info <- Master %>%
  filter(nameFirst == "David", nameLast == "Ortiz"))
# create Jeter_info info from the Master data frame 
(Jeter_info <- Master %>%
    filter(nameFirst == "Derek", nameLast == "Jeter"))
# create Ortiz_Jeter_batting that has Ortiz and Jeter's batting stats
Ortiz_Jeter_batting <- Batting %>%
  filter(playerID %in% c(Ortiz_info$playerID, Jeter_info$playerID))
# add SlugPct to the Ortiz_Jeter_batting data frame
Ortiz_Jeter_batting <- Ortiz_Jeter_batting %>%
  mutate(X1B = H - (X2B + X3B + HR), 
         OBP = (H + BB)/(AB + BB),
         SlugPct = (X1B + 2 * X2B + 3 * X3B + 4 * HR)/AB,
         OPS = OBP + SlugPct)
# create a boxplot to compare them
boxplot(OPS ~ playerID, data = Ortiz_Jeter_batting, names = c("Derek Jeter", "David Ortiz"), 
        ylab = "OPS")
```





$\\$


#### Part 1.6: Running a hypothesis test to compare David and Derek


We could also run a hypothesis test to compare David and Derek. Please answer the following questions: 


1) Does running a hypothesis test seem like a sensible thing to do? 

2) If so:
  a) what would the null and alternative hypotheses be? 
  b) what test should we run? 
  c) what is the population/process/underlying Truth we are exploring? 




**Answers**

1) I think so!

2a) $H_0: \mu_{OPT-Ortiz} - \mu_{OPT-Jeter} = 0$
2b) $H_A: \mu_{OPT-Ortiz} - \mu_{OPT-Jeter} \ne 0$
2c) It imagining if they had played in different circumstances (different games), and it's getting at their underlying ability (hand-eye coordination/strength).





```{r}
# run a hypothesis test to see if there is a statistically significant difference? 
t.test(OPS ~ playerID, data = Ortiz_Jeter_batting)
```






$\\$









#### Part 1.7: Fitting a regression model to come up with a better metric


Let's now use the lm() function to fit a linear regression model that can potentially do a better job at predicting runs.

We can also evaluate which variables seem to be useful for predicting runs.




```{r}
# fit the multiple regression model
fit <- lm(R ~ X1B + X2B + X3B + HR + BB + AB, data = team_batting)
# examine the coefficients
(baseball_coefs <- coef(fit))
# look at the model fit statistics
(summary_fit <- summary(fit))
```



**Questions:**  Do the values for the coefficients make sense? 






$\\$







#### Part 1.8: How good is our new statistic? 

```{r}
# extract the r^2 value
summary_fit$r.squared
```






$\\$






#### Part 1.9: Can we compare David and Derek on our new statistic? 


```{r}
# use the predict() function to get the OPT_stat for Ortiz and Jeter
Ortiz_Jeter_batting$OPT_stat <- predict(fit, newdata = Ortiz_Jeter_batting)
# createa  boxplot to compare them
boxplot(OPT_stat ~ playerID, data = Ortiz_Jeter_batting, names = c("Derek Jeter", "David Ortiz"), 
        ylab = "OPS")
# run a t-test to see if there is a statistically significant difference between these players
t.test(OPT_stat ~ playerID, data = Ortiz_Jeter_batting)
```









$\\$








#### Part 1.10: Can you come up with a regression model that has an even higher correlation with runs? 


Add new variables to the data frame that contain additional statistics (e.g., HR^2, etc) and see if you can come up with an even higher correlation value with runs. 


Do you think your new model will be better at predicting the number of runs a team scores in the upcoming 2020 baseball season? 



```{r}
team_batting2 <- mutate(team_batting, 
                        X1Bn = X1B/AB, 
                        X2Bn = X2B/AB, 
                        X3Bn = X3B/AB, 
                        XHRn = HR/AB, 
                        XBBn = BB/AB)                        
                        
fit2 <- lm(R ~ (X1B + X2B + X3B + HR + BB + X1Bn + X2Bn + X3Bn + XHRn + XBBn), data = team_batting2)
(summary_fit2 <- summary(fit2))
summary_fit2$r.squared
```


**Question:** Did something go wrong here?
