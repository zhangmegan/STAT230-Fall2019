## Part 1: Questions about homework 1? 


$\\$



#### Part 1.1: Adding names to side-by-side boxplots 

$\\$


We can add names below each boxplot in a side-by-side boxplot by setting the `names` argument to a vector of strings.


```{r}

load("misc_data.Rda")

boxplot(x1, x2, x3, x4,
        names = c("data 1", "data 2", "data 3", "data 4"),
        ylab = "Values")



```





#### Part 1.2: Removing data to make nicer plots


$\\$



Below is a solution to problem 3.3 of homework 1, where I tried to make a better looking pie chart by eliminating all states that had fewer than 200 baseball players born in them.



$\\$





```{r}

# download.file("https://yale.box.com/shared/static/p1akv464cut78w859pqqn15ebroxa2wm.rda", "players_born_1901_1950.Rda")

load("players_born_1901_1950.Rda")

# creating a table that counts how many players are born in each state
birth_place_counts <- table(players_born_1901_1950$birthState)

# create a vector of booleans that have TRUE values for states with > 200 players born in them
inds_counts_greater_200 <- birth_place_counts > 200

# extracting a vector of only the counts from states with > 200 players born in them
birth_place_counts_greater_200 <- birth_place_counts[inds_counts_greater_200]

# creating a vector of color names
colors = c("red", "orange", "yellow", "green", "blue", "cyan", "skyblue", "purple", "magenta")

# creating a pie chart with only states with > 200 players born in them (and nice colors!)
pie(birth_place_counts_greater_200, col = colors)

```


**Question:** What is problematic about this pie chart below? 



$\\$





Let's group all states with fewer than 200 players born in them into a single category called "Other". 

```{r}


# find all indices in the table with 200 of fewer counts
inds_counts_less_than_200 <- birth_place_counts <= 200


# sum together all the table entries with fewer than 200 counts
total_other <- sum(birth_place_counts[inds_counts_less_than_200])


# add a category called "other" that has the total counts from states < 200 born in them
birth_place_counts_greater_200["Other"] <- total_other


# create the pie chart (use the cex = .8 argument to make the text smaller)
pie(birth_place_counts_greater_200, cex = .8, col = colors)

```




$\\$




## Part 2: Review


$\\$


#### Part 2.1: For loops


$\\$


As discussed last class, for loops are useful when you want to repeat a piece of code many times under similar conditions. This is particularly useful for accumulating results in a vector. 

Let's accumulate the values 2^i for i in the range 1 to 100, and then plot them using the plot() function. 


```{r}

# create a loop to accumulate results for 2^i
the_results <- NULL
for (i in 1:100) {
	the_results[i] <- 2^i
}


# plot the results
plot(the_results, 
     type = "o",
     xlab = "x", 
     ylab = "2^x")



```




$\\$



## Part 3: Probability functions and generating random numbers in R


$\\$


#### Part 3.1: Probability density functions 



$\\$


Probability density functions can be used to model random events. All **probability density functions**, *f(x)*, have these properties:

1. The function are always non-negative
2. The area under the function integrates (sums) to 1

Which of the following are probability density functions? 


![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/emeyers/SDS230_F19/master/class_images/class_04/which_are_prob_densities.png)




$\\$


For continuous (quantitative) data, we use density function f(x) to find the probability (e.g., model of the long run frequency) that a random outcome X is between two values *a* and *b* using:


$P(a < X < b) = \int_{a}^{b}f(x)dx$


![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/emeyers/SDS230_F19/master/class_images/class_04/area_pdf.gif)




$\\$



#### Part 3.2: Probability density functions in R


$\\$


If we want to plot the true probability density function for the standard uniform distribution U(0, 1) we can use the dunif() function. All density function in base R start with d. 

```{r}


# the x-value domain for the density function f(x)
# these contain values from -.2 to 1.2 at increments of 0.001
x <- seq(-.2, 1.2, by = .001)  
y <- dunif(x)  # the density function at each value of x


# plot the probability density function 
plot(x, y, 
     type = 'l', 
     ylab = "f(x)", 
     main = "Standard uniform density")


```



**Question:** Can you create density plots for the normal and exponential distributions? 

```{r}
x_n <- seq(-2, 2, by = .001) 
x_e <- seq(0, 2, by = .001)  
plot(x_n, dnorm(x_n), type = "l")
plot(x_e, dexp(x_e), type = "l")
```

$\\$




#### Part 3.3: Generating random numbers in R

R has built in functions to generate data from different distributions. All these functions start with the letter r. 

We can also set the random number generator seed to always get the same sequence of random numbers.

Let's get a sample of n = 100 random points from the uniform distribution using runif()

```{r}

# set the seed to a specific number to always get the same sequence of random numbers
set.seed(21)

# generate n = 100 points from U(0, 1) using runif() function 
rand_data <- runif(100) 

# plot a histogram of these random numbers
hist(rand_data)

#me trying the other ones out
hist(rexp(1000))
hist(rnorm(1000))

```



$\\$



We can also calculate statistics for the central tendency such as the mean $\bar{x}$ and median $m$ and statistics of spread such as the standard deviation $s$ and the interquartile range. Use the mean(), median(), sd(), and IQR() functions to calculate these statistics on the sample of data we generated above. Also use the round() function to only show 3 decimal places of precision. 


```{r}

# Print the mean, median, sd, and IQR
# Also use the round() function to round to 3 decimal places
(the_mean <- round(mean(rand_data), 3))
(the_median <- round(median(rand_data), 3))
(the_sd <- round(sd(rand_data), 3))
(the_IQR <- round(IQR(rand_data), 3))

```


Note: closing assignment in parentheses causes the output to be printed. You should always print the output of your calculations to show your answers!  





$\\$




## Part 4: The law of large numbers


$\\$


The *law of large numbers* states that as the sample size *n* grows the sample average approaches the expected value (i.e., the parameter $\mu$). We can write this as $n \rightarrow \infty$  $\bar{x} \rightarrow \mu$. 

Let's use R to examine how the precision of the sample statistic for the mean ($\bar{x}$) changes as the sample size *n* increases. 


```{r}

# Using a for loop to calculate statistics from random samples of size n, as n increases
xbars <- NULL
for (i in 1:1000){
  
  rand_data <- rnorm(i)    
	xbars[i] <- mean(rand_data)    

}


library(latex2exp)

# plot the results (note \\ is needed for the lates2exp package)
plot(xbars, type = "l", xlab = "sample size (n)", ylab = TeX("$\\bar{x}"))


```



Let's examine this using data sample of sizes n is powers of 2 to see what happens with larger sample sizes. 


```{r}

# use a for loop to calculate means for normal data where n is powers of 2
xbars <- NULL
for (i in 1:20){
  
  rand_data <- rnorm(2^i)    
	xbars[i] <- mean(rand_data)    

}


# plot the results
plot(xbars, type = "o",  
     xlab = "log 2 of the sample size",
     ylim = c(-.7, .7))


# add a red horizontal line at the true parameter value
abline(h = 0, col = "red")



```



This is a nice theoretical property that our statistic converges to our parameter value (i.e., that our statistic is consistent), but we live in the *real world* where we have finite data. What is of real interest is if we have a finite sample size *n* what does the *distribution of statistics* we get look like, i.e., what does the **sampling distribtuion** look like? 






$\\$







## Part 5: Sampling distributions


#### Part 5.1

A distribution of statistics is called a **sampling distribution** 

Can you generate and plot a sampling distribution for:
 * sample means $\bar{x}$'s 
 * sample size n = 100
 * for data that come from uniform distribution


Note the shape of the *sampling distribution* can be quite different from the shape of the data distribution (which is uniform here).


```{r}

sampling_dist <- NULL

# create a sampling distribution of the mean using data from a uniform distribution
for (i in 1:1000){
  
  rand_sample <- runif(100) 
  sampling_dist[i] <- mean(rand_sample)
  
}


# plot a histogram of the sampling distribution of these means 
hist(sampling_dist, nclass = 100,
     xlab = bquote(bar(x)), 
     main = "Sampling distribution of the sample mean")


```




$\\$




#### Part 5.2: The standard error (SE)

The deviation of a sampling distribution is called the standard error (SE). Can you calculate the standard error for the sampling distribution you created above? 

```{r}


(SE <- sd(sampling_dist))


```




$\\$

 * The central limit theorem
