## Part 1: Hypothesis tests for a single proportion


$\\$


Recall the five steps of hypothesis testing:

 0) Plot your data
 1) State the null and alternative hypotheses, and choose an alpha level
 2) Calculate the observed statistic 
 3) Create a null distribution:  distribution of statistics if $H_0$ were true
 4) Calculate the p-value: 
   - probability of getting a statistic from the null distribution more extreme than the observed statistic 
 5) Make a judgement


It would be useful to memorize these steps!

## Do more than 25% of American's believe in ghosts? 

A telephone survey of 1000 randomly selected US adults found that 31% of them say they believe in ghosts. Does this provided evidence that more than 1 in 4 US adults believe in ghosts?  





##### Step 1: State the null and alternative hypotheses in symbols and words, and set up the rules of the game


**In words:** 

* Null hypothesis: 25 percent of Americans believe in ghosts 
* Alternative hypothesis: More than 25% of Americans believe in ghosts


**Using symbols**

$H_0: \pi = 0.25$
$H_A: \pi > 0.25$



**Rules of the game**

If there is a less than 5% probability we would get a random statistic as or more extreme than the observed statistic if $H_0$ we will reject $H_0$ and say $H_A$ is likely to be true.



$\alpha = 0.05$





$\\$





##### Step 2: Calculate the observed statistic

```{r ghost_obs_stat}

(obs_stat <- 0.31)

```





$\\$






##### Step 3: Create the null distribution



```{r null_dist_ghost}

flip_sims <- rbinom(10000, 1000, .25)

flip_sims_prop <- flip_sims/1000

```



$\\$







##### Step 4: Calculate a p-value


```{r p_value_ghost}


(p_value <- sum(flip_sims_prop >= obs_stat)/length(flip_sims))



```




$\\$








##### Step 5: Make a decision

Since `r p_value` is less than $\alpha = 0.05$ we can reject the null hypothesis (and perhaps say the results are "statistically significant").

## Part 2: One vs two tailed tests and permutation tests for comparing two sample means

Let's go through the logic of how to run a randomization (permutation) test for comparing 2 means...





## Part 3: Permutation tests for comparing two sample means in R



##### Step 0: Plot the data


```{r pill_plot}



treat <- c(7, -4, 18, 17, -3, -5,  1, 10, 11, -2)
control <- c(-1,  12,  -1,  -3,   3,  -5,   5,   2, -11,  -1,  -3)



# plot the data
boxplot(treat, control, 
        names = c("Treatment", "Control"),
        main = "Comparison of decrease in blood pressure",
        ylab = "Blood pressure decrease")



# create a stripchart
data_list <- list(treat, control) 
  
stripchart(data_list, 
           group.names = c("treatment", "control"), 
           main = "Comparison of decrease in blood pressure",
           xlab = "Blood pressure decrease", 
           col = c("red", "blue"))


```







##### Step 1: State the null and alternative hypotheses 


$H_0: \mu_{treat} - \mu_{control} = 0$
$H_A: \mu_{treat} - \mu_{control} > 0$


$\alpha = 0.05$




$\\$




##### Step 2: Calculate the observed statistic

```{r pill_obs_stat}


obs_stat <- mean(treat) - mean(control)



```



$\\$





##### Step 3: Create the null distribution



```{r null_dist_pill}


# combine the data from the treatment and control groups together
combined_data <- c(treat, control)


# use a for loop to create shuffled treatment and control groups and shuffled statistics 
null_distribution <-  NULL
for (i in 1:10000) {

       # shuffle data
        shuff_data <- sample(combined_data)

        # create fake treatment and control groups
        shuff_treat   <-  shuff_data[1:10]
        shuff_control  <-  shuff_data[11:21]

        # save the statistic of interest
        null_distribution[i] <- mean(shuff_treat) - mean(shuff_control)

        
}


# plot the null distribution as a histogram
hist(null_distribution, 
     nclass = 200,
     main = "Null distribution", 
     xlab = TeX("$\\bar{x}_{shuff-treat} - \\bar{x}_{shuff-control}$"))




```



$\\$




##### Step 4: Calculate a p-value


```{r p_value_pill}


# plot the null distribution again with a red line a the value of the observed statistic
hist(null_distribution, 
     nclass = 200,
     main = "Null distribution", 
     xlab = TeX("$\\bar{x}_{shuff-treat} - \\bar{x}_{shuff-control}$"))


abline(v = obs_stat, col = "red")



# calculate the p-value
(p_value <- sum(null_distribution >= obs_stat)/10000)




```




$\\$



##### Step 5: Make a decision

Since `r p_value` is greater than $\alpha = 0.05$ we can not reject the null hypothesis. Thus if we are using the Neyman-Pearson paradigm, we do not have sufficient evidence to say that the pill is effective.
